# Lung-Cancer-Risk-Prediction
A group project on predicting lung cancer risk using a three different machine learning models. 
I specifically did the LASSO Logistic Regression and Results sections.
In this repository there are two files of R code used for this project (one with probability threshold of 0.4 and another with the threshold at 0.5), a csv containing the data, and the paper in a pdf file.
