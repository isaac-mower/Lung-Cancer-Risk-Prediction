# Lung-Cancer-Risk-Prediction
A group project on predicting lung cancer risk using a three different machine learning models. 
I specifically did the LASSO Logistic Regression and Results sections.
In this repository there is the R code used for this project, a csv containing the data, and the paper in a pdf file.
